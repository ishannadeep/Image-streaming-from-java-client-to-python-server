# Image-streaming-from-java-client-to-python-server
This demo shows how to use java application to resize the given image into 1000*1000 pixels and split it into peices that has same width and height (200 pixels).Then encrypt it using AES hybrid 256 encryption algorithm and shows how to send those image segments to python 3 server.The server will decrypt it and combine them into the full image.

Also you can get the java version of encryption algorithm in below link.
